      One of my favorite television shows growing up was Bill Lawrence's Scrubs. I was motivated by the performances of the entire cast. This project is in its infancy(although I have worked on it off and on for some time), but I will try to perform text mining of the entire series using word count data cleaned from subtitle files found online. Big shout out to Roman Spektor for encouraging me to develop my coding skills with this very project. I write in R primarily, except when I'm devloping my HTML web pages, and I followed tidy principles with the help of <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/">This helpful book</a>. Please enjoy what I have to share, and reach out if you have thoughts or concerns.
